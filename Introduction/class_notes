    Interview Q&A.


AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript Framework.
    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables).

            Ex.

                 var i = 100;

                 var data = "Data From MongoDB Soon...";

                 where ( "i" & "data") called as Models.


            V - View

                - We Can Use html , html5 or JADE as the Template Language in AngularJS.

                - HTML5 Recomended as View in AngularJS

            C - Controllers.

                - JavaScript Functions Called as Controllers in AngularJS.

                - In Genaral we will write the Business Logic In Controllers.

              Ex.

                    function my_fun(){

                        //Business Logic

                    }

                 - where my_fun() used to implement the controller.


       - Angular Framework have a So Many Predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer we can use the Predefined Modules.

       [Note . Module . Collection Of "Classes Implementations" Called as Module ]


       1. ngAnimate.

            - used to implement the Animations in Angular Applications.

       2. ngMessages.

            - used to handle the client side form validations.

       3.ngStorage.

            - used to work with the Storages.

            - At Client Side (Browser) We Have Two Types Of Storages.

                1.localStorage

                2.sessionStorage

        4.ngRoute

            - used to implement the "routing" in Single Page Applications.

            - ngRoute Module is the Native module in AngularJS.

            - Now a days no body using the "ngRoute" Module in Single Page Applications because of it's
              limitations.


        5.ui.router

            - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

            - it is a 3rd party module.

            - now a days all most all the projects using "ui.router" module in Single Page Applications
              because of it's advantages.



       Ex.

        Develop Angular Application with the Following Features

        1.SPA - ui.router

        2.Animations

        3.Storages

        4.Validations


        index.html
        -
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html ng-app="app">

                //Logic Goes Here

            <script
                src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
            <script>

                    var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate",
                                                    "ngMessages",
                                                    "ngStorage",
                                                    "ui.router"]);
            </script>
        </html>


       - Predefined Modules eliminates the Much of the Code to write.


Advantages Of AngularJS.
-

1. As a Angular Developer We Can Work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.
Ex.
    Copy the Data From One "Div" to Another "Div" by using HTML & JavaScript.

    index.html
    -
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <div id="div_one"> Hello </div>
        <div id="div_two"></div>
        <script>
            document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
            document.getElementById("div_one").value;
        </script>
    </html>

    [Note. As a HTML Developer we must dependent on JavaScript to work with the HTML DOM ]

Ex.
    Copy the Data From One "Div" to Another "Div" by using AngularJS.


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app>
        <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
        <script
                src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    </html>

    [Note . We Can work with the HTML DOM By using Angular Directives.

            ng-app
            ng-model
            ng-bind ]



2. AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the SuperVision Of Controller
      called as Two Way Data Binding.

Ex.

        - In the Above Diagram we have following Server Calls.

1. http - (get request)
    - used to fetch the data from the database.


2. http - (delete request)
    - used to delete a perticular record from the database.


3. ajax (Asynchrous Request)
    - used to Sync the Data Between View & DataBase.


[Note.

1. As a Programming Languages Developer (Java, dot net, php,Android,...) we must make
   above all the requests to meet application requirement.

2. As a AngularJS , Angular2 Developer , we can make only two Requests to meet application requirement

3. Two Way Data Binding Reduces the Burden on the Server ]


3. AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server.

    - We Can Implement the Business Components At Client Side By using MVC ,
      Automatically Burden will be Reduced on Server.



4. Open Source Code.
    We Can Customize Framework accroding to application requirement.


5. Single Page Applications.
    - Loading the "Target Resources" to "Source Template" without refreshing the whole
      webpage called as Single Page Applications.

    - By Using AngularJS , Angular2 & Angular4 we can develop the Single Page Applications.


6. Angular Applications are Cross Browser Compatable Applications.

    - Angular Applications can Run in "all the Platforms" and "all the browsers" without
      adding the addional plugins to the web applications.

    - Latest Version of IE Also Supports Angular Applications.


Disadvantages Of AngularJS.
-
    - No Coding Standards in AngularJS, so Understanding the Angular Applications
      are Difficult.


    - Secuirity

        [We Are Implementing the Business Components at Client Side , So we are missing
        the Secuirity]

    - Client Should Enable the JavaScript , then only Angular Application Can Run in Browsers.
